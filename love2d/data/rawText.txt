It's a lazy summer day. Summer vacation is approaching fast, and with it the promise of freedom and bliss.

Throgh the filter of wistful thoughts the teacher's words are distant shreds spoken in a strange language.

The sands of time slowly trickle down the body constantly drawing attention to its passage.

A particularly sharp sound disturbs this little world once in a while, but it soon returns to its peaceful state.

Whole days pass like this, punctuated only by the ringing of school bells.

Such as now.

Slowly students gather the things and transform into an amorphous blob of lazyness.

The mind wanders...

Where am I gonna eat today...

Water...

Shower... shower... shower...

The Tests... maybe akin Ekin = Eel...

Do I need anything from-

"Fuck!" suddenly I'm stumbling backwards.
"Ow!" my head hit the floor hard, awakening me from my heat-induced stupor.
Slowly I begin straightening myself, when I recognize the cause of my fall in front of me.
