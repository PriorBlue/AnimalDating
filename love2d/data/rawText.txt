It's a lazy summer day. Summer vacation is approaching fast, and with it the promise of freedom and bliss.

Throgh the filter of wistful thoughts the teacher's words are distant shreds spoken in a strange language.

The sands of time slowly trickle down the body constantly drawing attention to its passage.

A particularly sharp sound disturbs this little world once in a while, but it soon returns to its peaceful state.

Whole days pass like this, punctuated only by the ringing of school bells.

Such as now.

Slowly students gather the things and transform into an amorphous blob of lazyness.

The mind wanders...

Where am I gonna eat today...

Water...

Shower... shower... shower...

The Tests... maybe Ekin = Eel...

Do I need anything from-

"Fuck!" suddenly I'm stumbling backwards.

"Ow!" my head hit the floor hard, awakening me from my heat-induced stupor.
Slowly I begin straightening myself, when I recognize the cause of my fall in front of me.

[result: fail]
	I watch as she gathers herself, apologizes and runs off. Too dazed to respond, I continue sitting on the spot for a couple of minutes.
	[Decision]
	[A] I think I should go to the doctor.
			[NEUTRAL END]
	[B] I collect myself and go to my next class.
			A couple days later you die of brain injury.
			[BAD END]
[result: success]

	A young, cute reason, about my age.
	[Decision]
	[A] "Sorry, my bad, I wasn't paying attention. I was lost in thoughts."
		???: "Oh, no worries. I really wasn't paying attention, either."
		She shoots you a sly look.
		???: "Don't tell the teachers about it, though. They've told me to pay attention so often, one of these days they'll kill me."
		"Sure."
		"By the way, I'm MC."
		Manari: "I'm Manari. I gotta go, but I'll see you around!"
		[Decision]
		[A] "Fuck, I completely forgot about class!"
			I start running in the direction of class. Behind me, I hear Manari's bubbly laugh.
		[B] "See you!"
			I remember that I was supposed to be in class and start running.
		[C] Hug her and leave.
			She tenses up, but then relaxes and returns the hug. She is warm and soft. After a couple of seconds, she untangles herself and, waving goodbye, leaves to go to class. 
			I really ought to do the same.
	[B] Apologize, excuse yourself and go to your next class.
			[NoImage]
			I sprint down the stairs into the classroom, just as biology class is about to start.

			"... and that is the difference between a theory and a hypothethis."
			The bell rings, and people start packing up.
			"Don't forget to study for the last test!"
			I join the stream of people leaving the classroom hurriedly.
			Suddenly, I feel something poking my arm. I turn, and end up facing assailant from the other day.
			MC: "Hey. Do you need something?"
			???: "Yeah, I need to apologize for slamming into you the other day."
			[Decision]
			[A] "No harm done."
				???: "Still, I feel really bad about it."
				MC: "Happens to the best of us."
			[B] "I'm sorry, who are you? I don't remember who I am."
				???: "Wha... you ass! Very funny."
				MC: "Thanks for checking in on me, though."
			[C] "Don't worry about me, are you okay?"
				???: "Worried about me, are you? Yeah, I'm completely fine."
